 <h3>Expression arrays: big matrices</h3>
 <p> This heatmap contains probes (in the rows) from expression arrays for a series of samples (in the columns) 
     of tumour tissues. 
     By default a <b>filter</b> which only shows the rows with outlier values is applied. The activated filter 
     only shows the rows that contain outlier values meanwhile the deactivated filter shows all the data, about
     two milliomillionells.
     Since this data set does only contain one value per probe and sample the <b>controls are hidden</b>.
